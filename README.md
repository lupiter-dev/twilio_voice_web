# twilio_voice_web
Flutter Web wrapper for Twilio Voice JS SDK

This plugin was created, as the present plugin https://pub.dev/packages/twilio_voice doen't provide web support.
Unfortunately, the Twilio JS SDK has some logical differences compared to the Android/iOS SDKs.
Therefore, it wasn't easily possible to integrate web support to the mention twilio_voice plugin.
