# twilio_voice_web_example

Demonstrates how to use the twilio_voice_web plugin.

## Getting Started

To be able to run this project, you need the following requirements:

- Twilio account with an activated phone number that can be used for phone calls
- A running backend service to retrieve an access token. The example app expects the token endpoint to be available at "http://localhost:8080/token".
 You can use one of the quick guides if you don't have your own backend at the moment: https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/sdks/javascript/get-started
